# Dinoverse - Artificial Life

![Alt text](Assets/Pictures/Island5.png)

Dive into the Dinoverse and observe the evolution of digital dinosaurs. Select the desired environmental conditions and observe how the dinosaurs learn to walk, find food and reproduce through natural selection alone. In the process, new survival strategies will develop again and again.

The Dinoverse is an Artificial Life simulation, which was created as part of my bachelor thesis. At the moment it's more of a zero-player game (like a digital dinosaur-aquarium), created for research purposes. However, an expansion to a full-fledged evolution simulation game is planned.


## Observe Evolution
The dinos are equipped with neuronal networks as brains and a range of changeable physical attributes. Whenever a dinosaur reproduces, the attributes are passed on to the offspring and mutated. In this way, natural selection takes place, because not every dinosaur will be good enough to pass on its genes to the next generation.

## How to use
Download and start the simulation from the *Exe* folder (Windows only). You can start the simulation with the default settings or create your own environmental conditions. But if the conditions are too challenging, the dinosaur population may die before it has had a chance to develop and adapt.

During the simulation, the ingame speed can be increased and environmental events can be triggered (but these are still beta). The camera can be moved with **WASD**, use **Q** and **E** to zoom.

The simulation data can be analyzed after or during the simulation. You will find automatically created files in the directory C:\Users\\*Username*\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Dinoverse. To evaluate the data, the Plot.ipynb file can be copied from the *Durchl√§ufe* directory to the same directory. The name of the desired PLT-file can then be copied into the Jupyter Notebook. The plots for the development of performance, physical attributes, species, and much more are created there.
